The current folder holds all the files used for the elements covered in the first HTML / CSS Workshop 
from May 21st, 2020!

Feel free to play around with the code on your local computer or just look through the powerpoint slides
to learn a bit about the languages.

More workshops on HTML, CSS, and Javascript may be coming soon so be sure to let us know if this is 
something you would be interested in. Happy coding!
